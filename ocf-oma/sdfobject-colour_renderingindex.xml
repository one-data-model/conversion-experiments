        <Description1>This Resource describes a Colour Rendering Index (CRI). The Property "cri" is an number. A colour rendering index (CRI) is a quantitative measure of the ability of a light source to reveal the colours of various objects faithfully in comparison with an ideal or natural light source. Light sources with a high CRI are desirable in colour-critical applications such as neonatal care and art restoration. It is defined by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) as follows:[1] Colour rendering: Effect of an illuminant on the colour appearance of objects by conscious or subconscious comparison with their colour appearance under a reference illuminant. The value often quoted as 'CRI' on commercially available lighting products is properly called the CIE Ra value, 'CRI' being a general term and CIE Ra being the international standard colour rendering index</Description1>
